                I was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Colorado and outdoorsy Boise, Idaho with my six siblings, mother and grandmother.
                I moved to San Francisco to compete in D1 running at University of San Francisco and study biology,
                then went on to complete my professional masters in biotechnology at the same school.
                My science career has consisted of a year graduate co-op at Amgen, three years at a cell therapy start up Nkarta,
                both located in South San Francisco, and some shorter bioinformatics projects at various companies.
            </p>

                I still am an active runner, competing with the oldest, all-women club
                in the United States, Impala Racing Team, in cross country, track and road races.
                My husband and I enjoy exploring trails and towns and surfing along Highway 1
                on the weekends. We both like going to yoga and meditation retreats to heal
                our bodies and to take time to slow down, and traveling to our national parks
                and to visit my family in Arizona and Idaho.
            </p>

                During my masters program, I was introduced to commandline, python, perl, sql
                 and R. I enjoyed going to courses and short bootcamps here and there at General
                 Assembly in San Francisco. To connect different web development areas and learn 
                 more skills, I'm currently in UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding part-time 
                 bootcamp and will finish the course in July 2020.
